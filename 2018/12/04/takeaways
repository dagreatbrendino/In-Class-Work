>quick review (if, arrays, vars)
console.log() is used to trouble shoot your js. The user doesn't see this on the front end.
document.write() can be used to write to the DOM, but genereally is not used because it overwrites the entire html file
If/else statements are critical! 
Statements are composed of an if, else- if, or else (keyword), a condtion, and the resulting code in {} curly breackets. 
Array is a list of items (variables or objects) that are grouped together in an indexed list. The elements of the array are likely related somehow.
Mostly unique to javascript, arrays do not need to have their size assigned when declared or assigned items. You can also add multiple types of variables and objects in a single array.


>Loops
For loops are critical in programming. (BADASS!!!!)
We use for loops to run repeated blocks of code over a set period.
Each for loop is coomposed of a:
    -Variable declaration or counter (iterator)
    -Loop condition
    -An iteration (addition)
//Start with an Array.
    var vegetables = ["Carrots", "Peas", "Lettuce", "Tomatoes"];

//Loops through each index of the Array.
    for (var i = 0; i < vegetables.length; i++) {
        console.log("I love " + vegetables[i]); 
    }
//The above function will loop through vegetables array printing every item until it reaches the last index. 
//Note: vegetables.length is a property and NOT a function which is why there are no parenthesis
