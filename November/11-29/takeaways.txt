Objectives 
>Grid Based web design in web dev
Use a detailed sketch to get started.
 Pay particular attention to the location of navigation bars, titles, headers, content, images, footers etc.
When imagining allignments in particular, be mindful of the grid
Grids serve to allign elements aesthetically along theoretical columns and rows. FB is a perfect example.

Rows and columns are applied to the html via classes and typically are applied to particular containers 

>Bootstrap grid system for layout
Let's you organize content baesd on the "number of columns" a div spans- out of a total 12 columns
Every bootstrap grid is made up of...
    containers which wrap around the entire grid  
    rows which are defined first and are just rows
    columns which are defined within rows and specify the columns. The sum total of all columns within a row must add up to 12

Each of these elements is implemented by creating a block element 

>Mobile responsive web design using media queries and break points
Seems to be pretty straight forward so far

html- structure
css - style 
js - behavior
